            <h2>Fixed Gear</h2>
            <p>A fixed-gear or fixed-wheel bicycle, commonly known as a fixie, is a bicycle that has a drivetrain
                with no freewheel mechanism. The freewheel was developed early in the history of bicycle design but
                the fixed-gear bicycle remained the standard track racing design. More recently the 'fixie' has
                become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists, offering the advantages of simplicity
                compared with the standard multi-geared bicycle.</p>
